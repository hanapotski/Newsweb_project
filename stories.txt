Teachers Awarded A Raise
Congress passed a bill today that will change the state of 
education in the U.S. The Alder's Education Reform Bill, 
sponsored by Florida Democrat David Alders, gives teachers a 
raise as part of a major overhaul of the entire education system. 
The raise is expected to be between 33% and 47%, depending 
upon years of service. The entire package will cost the federal 
government billions over the next 10 years. In a press conference, 
Congressman Alders said: "It's the least we can do for tomorrow's 
future."



Kingfish Return Early
From all reports this week it seems we are getting a little early 
push of kingfish in the area. Some nice ones were caught close 
to the beach at Redington as well as off St. Pete. Beach near the
artificial reef. They all were nice sized fish over 20 pounds and 
were caught among schools of large Spanish mackerel. Of course 
Spanish mackerel is just about their favorite food when they are 
around. The Spanish have been large as well, from 4 to 7 pounds 
being the average size caught by the live bait fishermen. The only
problem right now is that you will have to move around enough 
to find water that is free of red tide and that can be difficult as 
windy as it has been.
