          <h2>Teachers Awarded A Raise</h2>
          <img id="teachers" src="images/teachers.jpg" alt="teachers">
          <p>Congress passed a bill today that will change the state of
          education in the U.S. The Alder's Education Reform Bill,
          sponsored by Florida Democrat David Alders, gives teachers a
          raise as part of a major overhaul of the entire education system.
          The raise is expected to be between 33% and 47%, depending
          upon years of service. The entire package will cost the federal
          government billions over the next 10 years. In a press conference,
          Congressman Alders said: "It's the least we can do for tomorrow's
          future."</p><br>

          <h2>Kingfish Return Early</h2>
          <img id="boat" src="images/boat.jpg" alt="boat">
          <p>From all reports this week it seems we are getting a little early
          push of kingfish in the area. Some nice ones were caught close
          to the beach at Redington as well as off St. Pete. Beach near the
          artificial reef. They all were nice sized fish over 20 pounds and
          were caught among schools of large Spanish mackerel. Of course
          Spanish mackerel is just about their favorite food when they are
          around. The Spanish have been large as well, from 4 to 7 pounds
          being the average size caught by the live bait fishermen. The only
          problem right now is that you will have to move around enough
          to find water that is free of red tide and that can be difficult as
          windy as it has been.</p>
